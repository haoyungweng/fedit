They were first proposed in the early 20th century by Nikola Tesla and others, but they were not widely studied until the late 1960s when scientists began to investigate their potential for space travel.\nThe basic principle behind an EM drive is that it uses magnetic fields to accelerate particles towards a target. This can be done either through direct acceleration (where the particle is accelerated directly from rest) or through induction (where the particle is accelerated indirectly by creating a magnetic field around itself). The resulting motion of the particle is then used to propel the spacecraft forward.", "category": "paraphrase"}
